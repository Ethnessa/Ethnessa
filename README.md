# TShock Modified
What is this? As of right now it is a fork of TShock which features a complete database provider switch. We use MongoDB for local server and global server storage. This is the only major change at the moment, apart from minor changes here and there.

## Why?
We are a group of developers that are working on creating a new Terraria server network, and we will be using this fork of TShock.
